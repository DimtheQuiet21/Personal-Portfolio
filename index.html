                    <p class = "text-3">I come from Birmingham, AL in the deepness of the American South. After spending most of my life dreading the arrival of the summertime sweats, I decided to move up North to Wisconsin. Now I nearly freeze every February. I earned my Master's in Chemistry, and then began a PhD in Archaeology (or Anthropology if you're nitpicky about it). I study ancient blacksmithing of South Asia. I began coding for my dissertation and realized how much I enjoyed it, and that I was pretty good at it. Now I'm an aspiring web developer and webdesigner.</p>
