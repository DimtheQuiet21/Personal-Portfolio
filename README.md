# Personal-Portfolio# Code Refactor Starter Code - by Alan Lee

## Description

This personal profile will act as an introduction to my works as well as my personality as a web developer and web designer. This profile should demonstrate my current skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript. It will be updated on a semi-frequent bassis to reflect my growth as a developer.


This current version of my personal profile features several things.
1). Fully funcitoning links to my projects (academic, professional, and personal)
2). Adaptive and reactive page layouts for improved mobile and desktop experiences
3). A showcase of my personal skill as an artist (the flaming cube is my own design)
4). Interactive images that improve the user experience via utilizing puesdoclasses.

This profile pafe should both be fully functional and accessible to all users as well as easy to adapt and update in the future.

Through the process of creating my personal profile I have learned the importance of clearly and effectively ordering the elements so that they are both clear, concise, and most importantly accessible to the audience. I have made the interface of the portfolio simple but engaging with plenty of user friendly features to improve the overall experience.
